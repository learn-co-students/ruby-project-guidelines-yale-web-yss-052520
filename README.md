# Flatiron Module One Final Project: COVID-19 App
# Made by Ziming Mao and Chad Palmer

## Short Description

This app enables users to search for data on COVID-19 cases worldwide, hosted on the COVID-19 API (https://covid19api.com/), through a user-friendly interface. It also allows users to compare data from multiple countries and filter that data based on date and case type. The data compiled can also be plotted into graphs and exported as both graphs and text files. 

## Features

1. Filter Covid-19 data by one country, or by multiple countries
2. Filter Covid-19 data by one date, or by a range of dates
3. Output data in .txt files, as text or as graphs in ASCII format
4. Keep track of past queries and retrieve past queries if needed
5. Select case types, such as active cases, confirmed cases, number of deaths
6. Select the data type to be "cumulative" (i.e. total number of cases) or "daily" (i.e. new cases per day)
