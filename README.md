# Black Lives Matter Email to Representatives 

Recent events in the U.S. have once again proven our nation's systematic racial discrimination and injustice. This app allows users to stand against police brutality as well as COVID-19's disproportionate impact on Black people by demanding justice from authorities. Specifically, it generates a link to send emails to local, state, and national representatives based on the user's location. We have gathered data on elected officials using an Application Programming Interface (API) called the [Google Civic Information API](https://developers.google.com/civic-information). We have written a simple Command Line Application (CLI) in [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) to interact with the user. 

## Install Instructions and Using the App

To use this app, you will need to have Ruby installed. Look [here](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) for detailed instructions. You will also need to have Git installed and can look [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) for details.

Once you have Ruby and Git installed, you need to type the following commands in your terminal:

```
   git clone https://github.com/anmolk18/blm-email-yale-web-project-mod1.git
   cd blm-email-yale-web-project-mod1
   rake db:migrate
   ruby bin/run.rb
```
The app should now be running and you will be inputting some information, such as your name, address, and your support for/against the Black Lives Matter movement. You will eventually be given an email link with a pre-written message to officals based on the address they provided. You will even be given the option of writing a personalized comment in the body of their email.
